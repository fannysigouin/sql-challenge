## Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

This challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

### Data Modeling 

An entity relationship diagram was created using QuickDB to map out the database and its tables:

### Data Engineering

The six tables in the database were created to import the corresponding CSV files, specifying data types, primary and foreign keys, and other constraints.

### Data Analysis

With the complete database and tables, the following queries were created:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
